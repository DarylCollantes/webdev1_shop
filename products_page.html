                            A deep, dark blue, with countless sparkles throughout, the stone is reminiscent of nothing less than looking into a night sky full of stars.  
                            It’s associated with ambition, wishes and desires, and is regarded as a symbol of protection, as well.

                            The base color is a subtle, sometimes milky blue.  It’s viewed as a symbol of inner strength, empowerment and balance.

                        <h3>Bloodstone</h3>
                        <p>
                            Bloodstone, sometimes called “the martyr’s stone,” is so named for the stark contrast posed by the red speckles among the predominantly green stone.  
                            A second alternate name, heliotrope, refers to the way some polished specimens reflect sunlight.  
                            Bloodstone is the traditional birthstone for March, the Zodiac birthstone for Aries, and an alternate for both Aquarius and Pisces. 
                            It is associated primarily with endurance, but also regarded as a symbol of justice.  
                            A particularly famous specimen is housed at the Louvre museum in Paris, which bears a carved seal of German Emperor Rudolf II.

                            Tiger’s Eye is formed from quartz, and as a chatoyant gemstone has a unique, silky luster, meaning it can appear to shift and shimmer depending on the angle from which one views it. 
                            The stone is sometimes regarded as a symbol of well-being, stability and clarity.

                            Obsidian is formed from cooling lava – a stone forged in volcanic flame.  
                            In addition to its decorative uses, obsidian was used by stone age people for weapons and tools, and later, by Native Americans and Incans for weapons, mirrors and masks.  
                            Naturally, given its origins, Obsidian is often associated with the earth and fire, and symbolizes stabilization and grounding.

                            On this set, the text, rather than being engraved or embossed, is actually raised, making them a truly unique addition to any dice collection.

                        <p>
                            Cherry is one of the few woods that one may wish to leave in the sunshine to darken, perhaps on a windowsill for a few days. 
                            It will shift from a pale, pinkish red to a deep, warm, reddish brown. This color change is initially rapid, visible day to day, but slows gradually. 
                            Like most fruit woods, cherry works easily, and can feature vivid grain. A classic, tasteful American wood for furniture and paneling.

                        <p>
                            Padauk is an exotic wood that is a bright orange or almost crimson wood when freshly cut, but oxidizes to a darker, rich purple-brown over time. 
                            It is a good wood in all respects – stable, and easy to work with. It often grows in small groups and is reported to be common in dense equatorial rain forests.

                        <p>
                            Also known as Chechen, Black Poisonwood is a vibrant deep colored wood. 
                            Coming from the same family of plants as Poison Ivy (the family Anacardiaceae) the bark of the tree produces urushiol which is the same chemical skin irritant that Poison Ivy produces. 
                            Hence the name: Poisonwood. Don’t worry, the heartwood of the tree doesn’t contain any of the compound and is completely non-toxic.

                        <p>
                            Extremely popular and sought after, rosewood is the quintessential wood for inlay, turnings, carvings and many musical instruments. 
                            Very hard, fine-grained, and crisp, there are many varieties of rosewood, some sold under other names. 
                            All of them take a beautiful polish and are considered fine tonal woods. Unquestionably one of the finest woods we offer, rosewood speaks of refinement and grace.

                        <p>
                            Spalting, a chaotic pattern of striking dark lines through a piece of wood, is found in many species of wood, including Tamarind & Maple. The pattern can be thought of as “property lines” between warring varieties of fungus. 
                            In pieces of spalted wood, the fungus infects the wood, but has been stopped while the lumber remains viable. Each piece of Spalted Timber will have a unique appearance, making it a very popular exotic selection.

                            Purpleheart is a very hard, dense wood, primarily known for its remarkable coloring. One of our most highly varied woods in hue, it ranges from warm and subtle plum to vivid, cool shades of violet. 
                            Over time, the color will mellow to a rich tint. Purpleheart is unmistakable, unique among thousands of wood species, and many collectors count it as a favorite.

                            Deep black stripes play over the deep brown background in this striking Ebony. While Macassar Ebony isn’t nearly as dark or uniform as Gabon Ebony, it more than makes up for it with its deep and intriguing grain. 
                            Hailing from South East Asia, Macassar Ebony is a difficult wood to work, prone to cracking and and exhibiting a great deal of wood movement, but the challenge is well worth it when you see the final piece.
